Adds an 'event board' to display your events in a responsive posterboard.

## Description ##

### Basic Usage ###

To display the event posterboard simply use the shortcode `[event_board]` on any page or post. Full width pages work best.

### Filters ###

You can add filters at the top of the event board to filter the events. Supported filters include:
 
 * venue
 * category
 * city (*when installed with Event Organiser Pro*)
 * state (*when installed with Event Organiser Pro*)
 * country (*when installed with Event Organiser Pro*)

For example

     [event_board filters="state"]
     
You can display multiple filters by listing them as a comma delimited list

     [event_board filters="venue,category"]
     

You can edit the template used for the event board. See the FAQ.
     
## Installation ##

Installation and set-up is standard and straight forward. 

1. Upload `event-organiser-event-board` folder (and all it's contents!) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the shortcode to a page.


## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Can I change the content of the event boxes ###
Yes. By default the plug-in uses the template found in `event-organiser-event-board/templates`. 
Simply copy that template (`single-event-board-item.html`) into your theme and edit it there. Please note that the template uses **underscore.js** templating.
